# SecondLanguageLearner

An assignment in which I interviewed a person (Ayumi) whose second language was English, and analysed their strengths and weaknesses using the "error analysis" technique, where errors in her speech were evaluated against how a native English speaker would say the same thing. I discuss factors that may affect the person acquisition of English, and give suggestions and advice as to how she can enhance her learning.

Personally identifying information relating to Ayumi (including her real name) have been anonymized to keep her privacy.
